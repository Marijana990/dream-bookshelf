            <p>The Only Apps I Use More Than Goodreads Are My Bank App And Libby. I Started Using It Long Before I Had My Kindle, And The Fact That The Kindle Connects To My Goodreads Has Made The Whole Experience Even More Enjoyable.</p>

            <p>4.5/5 I Love Using DB Because It Keeps Me Accountable So I Actually Finish Most Of The Books I Start Instead Of Just Moving On To A New Book. I Also Love How Organized It Lets Me Be With My Books So I Know Exactly Which Books I've Read. -Jolie R</p>

            <p>A Favorite Feauture Of Mine Is The Preview Feature, Which Allows The Reader To Read A Few Chapters (Depending The Chapters Lengths And Books Itself). </p>
